# Ensemble-with-me
Make it easy for people to find other people to ensemble with.

1. Write a press release

Have you ever tried to schedule a pair or mob
programming session? How did that work out for you?

If your experience is similar to our own, it probably
didn't work out as smoothly as you'd hoped. That's
why we created EnsembleWith.Me!

When you first land there, if we don't know, we'll ask
what you want to pair or ensemble on (your preferred
computer and spoken language or languages,
the time or times you are available, your time zone)
so you can immediately search for others to pair or
ensemble with.

If we do know you, we'll immediately show you some
matches based on your preferences.

2. Write a FAQ

Q. Do I need an account to connect with others?

A. No account is needed to see if others are available
who fit your preferences. You will need to create an
account before you can schedule a session.

Q. Do I need to share my private contact details (email)
with others in order to schedule a session with them?

A. No. Scheduling is done without the need for you to
share your personal details.
